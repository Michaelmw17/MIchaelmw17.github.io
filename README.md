### User Story

I am Michael Watt, I am studying Full Stack Web Development at the University of Sydney, with skills in Javascript,  Html, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, API's, Node, Express, MySQL, NoSQL, MongoDB  and responsive web design.

I have completed Certificate 4 in Business Studies and have experience in customer service and business. Iâ€™m motivated to become a web developer as I really like the problem solving aspects of web design and building a website that creates a great UI and UX experience.

I love to learn and enjoy the team work component of web design. I understand how important it is to communicate with the team, to encourage everyone to brainstorm ideas and work through the best design approach.

In summary I would describe myself as:

An organised and open minded person with creative ideas, who is motivated to use my skills and knowledge in a web development team. I am able to work independently as well as in a team to deliver on common goals.
